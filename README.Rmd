# About

When I switches from Stata to R, there're three commands in Stata that I missed most:
- `d`, that is, `describe`
- `lookfor`
- `codebook, compact`

These commands present __me__ta__da__ta records for datasets in a cleaned way. 

This package provides R functions that replicates the behavior of these commands.
The package is built upon two R packages: `haven`, which provides a labelled class that supports labelled data frames, and `labelled`, which makes it easier to work with 
labelled data frames.

# Installation

Since the `labelled` package is still not up on CRAN, we might also install it as well.

```
devtools::install_github("larmarange/labelled")
devtools::install_github("jjchern/meta")
```
